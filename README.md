# Predict Customer Churn

## Project Description
Customer Churn is a condition in which consumers do not continue or leave the services offered by an industry. If not handled, it will lead to loss of revenue and even loss. To overcome this, we need to know which consumers have the potential to churn, so that we can focus on grabbing those consumers and know the constraints in the services the industry provides.

This project aims to find which of the following classification algorithms, Random Forest or Logistic Regression, performs better at predicting the Credit Card customer churn.
